# mysteryWord
Mystery Word is a small console application written in Python, this app is meant to be ran once with the word parameters as the encrypted key and the if statements code block as the bit shifter. A software engineer will look at the code and try to guess what the mystery word is by trying to guess the mystery word simply by reading the if statement and the words in the parameter. Once the user (software engineer) runs the code the mystery code will always be the same unless you change the values []  to different integers,  thus changing the mystery word.
